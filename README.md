A powerful, portable AI for Windows.

Hey guys! So ive been working on a open-source, easy to use, AI for Windows.

Its still in development and needs alot of work, but, well its a console ai. And you can have a chat with it, search something on google, check your weather, run apps on your pc, do various tasks on your pc like shut it down etc.


Its in early development stage, but i think its pretty useful because unlike cortana, this AI can fit on your usb drive easily, its only 5 mb :0

But very efficient. So i decided to upload it to GitHub for everyone, and if you wanna help make it better.

You can get the latest stable build from
